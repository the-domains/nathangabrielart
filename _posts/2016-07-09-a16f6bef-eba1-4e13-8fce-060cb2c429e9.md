My Druid wizard staff, built for a photo project I had been working on, it was postponed for a while and I didn't end up finishing the project, though it is definitely a project I am interested in finishing. I had tons of fun with building this and working with a new material is always interesting. The entire staff is built mostly from PVC apwith sme sculpted areas done in epoxy resin material by smooth on products.
